# Authorship_Identification
In this work, Autoencoder is used to reduce the feature vector size created from the Doc2Vec tools. different ML based classifiers are applied on the learnt feature vector.
NN_auto.py is the main file to run the program.
Fetching tweets.py reads the tweets from the created dataset.
Reading_mails.py reads the mails from enron dataset.
Doc2vec2.py reads data from the RCV dataset and then create the vector.
The datasets are available publicly, and the link for the created dataset is availble in the report.
